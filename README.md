> A FeathersJS chat application

## About

This repository includes the server application from the [official Feathers chat guide](https://dove.feathersjs.com/guides/basics/generator.html) as well as chat frontend examples for different frameworks.

## API server

### TypeScript

The TypeScript version of the chat API server can be found in the [feathers-chat-ts](./feathers-chat-ts/). To start it install the dependencies like this:

```
cd feathers-chat-ts
npm install
```

Then compile the source code and run the database migration which will initialize an SQLite database in the `feathers-chat.sqlite` file.

```
npm run compile
npm run migrate
```

It can now be started with:

```
npm start
```

Or in development mode with

```
npm run dev
```

Now go to [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) to start chatting üïäÔ∏è
